## General overview: 

<p style="font-family:georgia"> 
For this project my goal was to create a fitness tracker Application that will allow the user to add workouts to a database save it and view it using mongoDB, express, & JavaScript. I built the server.js, models, route files from a collection of notes and general knowledge to successfully setup express and link the backend to the front end. The user will now be able to use the site to add in workouts and view data with a click of a button.
